# unicode_finder

## App Description

This tool scans Word documents to detect and highlight hidden or non-standard Unicode characters that are often invisible during normal editing but can cause formatting or processing issues. Specifically, it identifies and reports the following characters:

- **U+202F** (Narrow No-Break Space)  
- **U+200B** (Zero Width Space)  
- **U+2060** (Word Joiner)  
- **U+00A0** (Non-Breaking Space)  
- **U+200C** (Zero Width Non-Joiner)  
- **U+200D** (Zero Width Joiner)  
- **U+2061** (Function Application)  

By flagging these characters, the app helps users clean and normalize their documents, ensuring consistent formatting, improved readability, and smoother downstream text processing.

## App Usage
Either run the python script or execute the .exe-file located in the dist/ directory on windows machines.
